      Extract the game name from a youtube video title of northernlion, a streamer, and you will need to extract the game name, if one is evident. Game names are often, but not always, in parenthesis at the end of the video title. If a game name is not evident, instead return [[Undectable]] - else return game name only, in lower case. The video title is:
      {{Video}}
